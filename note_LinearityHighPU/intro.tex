In Run III and HL-LHC phases, the LHC will collide at instantenous luminosities of XXX\ \instlumiunit\ and XXX\ \instlumiunit, respectively, with correspond to pile-up values of about XXX and XXX, by comparison the Run II average pile-up was about 34. 
During 2018, special LHC Runs were recorded with high pile-up over 100, these runs allow for studies of the relative linearity between luminometers and effects of the large pile-up expected in the high luminosity phases of the LHC.
